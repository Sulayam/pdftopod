# Vestas 2024: The Wind Giant's Risky Bet on Fewer, Better Customers

*~2493 words*

**Alex:** What if I told you that the world's largest wind company just had their best year ever... by saying no to customers?

**Jordan:** Wait, saying no to customers? That sounds counterintuitive for a growth business.

**Alex:** Right? But Vestas made this radical pivot in 2024 that tripled their profit margins, though it might have put their future at serious risk. I'm Alex, here with Jordan, and we're diving into Vestas' annual report to understand how they're gambling everything on 'value over volume.'

**Jordan:** And this is happening in a market that needs to grow 600% by 2050. So let's break this down - what exactly did they do differently?

**Alex:** Okay, so picture this - you know how trendy restaurants get really picky about reservations once they become popular? That's basically what Vestas did.

**Jordan:** Hmm, I can see the analogy, but give me the actual numbers here.

**Alex:** Their EBIT margin jumped from 1.5% to 4.3% - that's almost tripling their profitability! And this was on 17.3 billion euros in revenue with a record backlog of 68.4 billion euros.

**Jordan:** Wait, those are huge numbers. So they're more profitable AND they have more future work lined up?

**Alex:** Exactly! Their Power Solutions business - that's the actual turbine manufacturing - had a dramatic turnaround with profitability increasing 6.1 percentage points year-over-year.

**Jordan:** Hold on - 6.1 percentage points is massive in manufacturing. That's not just optimization, that's a fundamental business model shift. But how exactly does being pickier about customers translate to better margins? What's the mechanism here?

**Alex:** So instead of taking every project that comes their way, they're focusing on what they call 'value over volume.' Think premium customers who pay better rates, have less risky projects, you know? They're literally prioritizing profitable solutions over just chasing market share.

**Jordan:** I get the concept, but I'm already seeing a potential problem here. If the world desperately needs more wind energy, can they really afford to be this selective?

**Alex:** That's exactly the tension we need to explore! Because when you look at the growth numbers, it's absolutely massive. Wind currently accounts for only 8% of global electricity generation.

**Jordan:** Only 8%? That seems surprisingly low for all the talk about wind energy. I would have guessed it was much higher by now.

**Alex:** Right? But here's where it gets crazy - that share is expected to more than double by 2035. And to hit net zero climate goals, wind capacity needs to explode from 1,000 gigawatts in 2023 to 7,900 gigawatts by 2050.

**Jordan:** Wait, let me make sure I understand this. They need to increase wind capacity by almost 8 times in just 26 years? That's like building the entire current wind industry seven more times over.

**Alex:** Exactly! And that means annual installations need to jump from 117 gigawatts in 2023 to over 300 gigawatts per year by 2050. It's like scaling a small restaurant to feed an entire city. The intermediate target is even more daunting - they need to hit 4,500 gigawatts by 2035.

**Jordan:** Okay, so now I'm really confused about this 'value over volume' strategy. How can they be picky when the world needs this much capacity? The math doesn't seem to work.

**Alex:** Well, Vestas is betting that the market will reward quality players. They expect onshore wind to grow 7-9% annually and offshore to grow 20-25% annually through 2030. They think there's room to be selective while still growing.

**Jordan:** Those offshore numbers are huge. 20-25% growth annually means the market's basically doubling every few years. But wait - where's all this new electricity demand even coming from?

**Alex:** And there's this whole new demand driver too - AI and data centers. Get this: a single hyperscale data center consumes as much electricity as 350,000 to 400,000 electric cars annually.

**Jordan:** That's insane. So AI is literally creating massive new electricity demand just as we're trying to decarbonize everything else. One data center equals 400,000 cars? That puts the whole AI boom in a completely different perspective.

**Alex:** Exactly! Which brings us to what might be Vestas' biggest challenge - their service business. They run the largest service operation in the wind industry.

**Jordan:** What do you mean by service business? Like maintenance and repairs?

**Alex:** Yeah, they service 155 gigawatts across 56,000 turbines in 71 countries. That's growing from 149 gigawatts in 2023. Their service backlog alone is 36.8 billion euros with 11-year average contracts.

**Jordan:** Wow, so they're not just selling turbines, they're basically married to their customers for over a decade. That's a huge recurring revenue stream. But 56,000 turbines? That's like having to maintain a small city's worth of infrastructure scattered across the globe.

**Alex:** Right! It's like selling someone a car and then being their mechanic for the next 11 years. Great for steady cash flow, but also a massive operational challenge. And that's where some of their problems are showing up.

**Jordan:** But wait, Alex - you're glossing over some serious red flags here. They had to do major cost adjustments because of operational inefficiencies, right? This doesn't sound like a company that's got everything figured out.

**Alex:** Well, yeah, they did have some challenges in autumn 2024 due to sustained inflation and operational issues...

**Jordan:** Some challenges? They're dealing with quality issues across ALL business areas, and they're literally missing their own sustainability targets. For a company that's supposed to be leading the green transition, isn't that a bit hypocritical?

**Alex:** Okay, you're right to call that out. They acknowledge quality isn't where it should be, and they will miss their 2025 target of 55% GHG emissions reduction. That's pretty significant for a renewables company.

**Jordan:** How can we trust their rosy growth projections when they can't even manage their existing operations properly? This seems like a fundamental credibility issue. They're telling investors about 'value over volume' while their service customers are apparently getting subpar quality.

**Alex:** Fair point. Though they do have a recovery plan with standardized cost control and intelligent work order scheduling. And their customer satisfaction score is still 44, which isn't terrible. That's their Net Promoter Score for the service business.

**Jordan:** A 44 satisfaction score when you're the market leader? That doesn't exactly scream 'premium service' to me. If you're going to charge premium prices for 'value over volume,' shouldn't your service be exceptional?

**Alex:** You're not wrong. But here's where it gets interesting for their future strategy - they're making a big bet on offshore wind. They secured 4.6 gigawatts of offshore orders, including their first US offshore deal. That's where the real growth and margins are.

**Jordan:** Offshore is definitely where the growth is, but isn't that also where their sustainability problems are coming from? And if they're just starting in the US offshore market, that's a whole new set of operational challenges.

**Alex:** Yeah, the offshore operations are part of why they'll miss their 2025 sustainability targets. It's this weird situation where growth and their environmental goals are in tension. The offshore business is more complex and carbon-intensive initially.

**Jordan:** So they're prioritizing growth over their stated environmental commitments. That doesn't sound very 'value over volume' to me. It sounds like they're volume-chasing in offshore while being selective onshore.

**Alex:** Well, they are planning to start manufacturing their V236 turbines in 2025, though they expect that to impact margins initially during the ramp-up phase. So they're aware there are trade-offs.

**Jordan:** More margin pressure from new manufacturing. So let me get this straight - they've improved margins by being selective, but now they're entering new markets that will hurt those margins, while dealing with quality issues in their existing business?

**Alex:** It's definitely a balancing act. But they're confident enough to plan dividend payments and share buybacks. They want to return value to shareholders while maintaining what they call 'double-digit profitability.'

**Jordan:** Returning cash to shareholders while they have quality issues and are missing sustainability targets? That's an interesting priority choice. Are they optimizing for short-term shareholder returns at the expense of long-term operational excellence?

**Alex:** I mean, they do have ambitious targets going forward - carbon neutrality by 2030 without offsets, and a 45% reduction in supply chain emissions intensity. They're not giving up on sustainability.

**Jordan:** But they just admitted they can't hit their current targets! Why should we believe they'll hit even more ambitious future targets? And 'without offsets' - that's actually a pretty bold commitment if they can pull it off.

**Alex:** That's the million dollar question, isn't it? And there's another interesting dynamic here - they say the market is being driven by security and cost concerns, not climate goals anymore.

**Jordan:** That's actually pretty revealing. So the green transition is happening for economic and geopolitical reasons, not environmental ones? That changes the whole narrative about why this industry is growing.

**Alex:** Exactly. Wind energy costs have fallen 60% for onshore and 70% for offshore over the past decade. It's just become the cheapest new electricity source in many places. The business case doesn't need the environmental argument anymore.

**Jordan:** So Vestas is riding this cost advantage wave while trying to maintain premium pricing through their 'value over volume' approach. That seems like it could backfire if competitors undercut them. If wind is the cheapest option, why pay premium prices?

**Alex:** True, but they do have scale advantages. With 189 gigawatts installed across 88 countries, they're basically everywhere already. That's a huge installed base for their service business.

**Jordan:** Scale is great, but if they're having quality and operational issues across that entire footprint, scale could actually make problems worse, not better. Every quality issue gets magnified across thousands of turbines.

**Alex:** That's a really good point. They're trying to optimize what they call their 'industrial system' from 'push to pull' to be more responsive to customer needs. Basically shifting from forecasting demand to responding to actual orders.

**Jordan:** Industrial buzzwords aside, can they actually execute on this transformation while managing massive growth and fixing their existing problems? That's like trying to rebuild the airplane while you're flying it.

**Alex:** And that's really the core question here. They're making this high-stakes bet that they can stay selective about customers while the wind market absolutely explodes. They say they want to 'outgrow the total onshore market in firm order intake' - so grow faster than the overall market while being picky.

**Jordan:** Right. It's like trying to run an exclusive restaurant while the city is experiencing a food shortage. At some point, don't you have a responsibility to serve more people? Especially when we're talking about climate infrastructure.

**Alex:** Especially when we're talking about climate change. This isn't just about business strategy - there are real environmental consequences if wind deployment doesn't scale fast enough. We need to hit 300 gigawatts of new installations per year by 2050, and we're currently at 117.

**Jordan:** Exactly. And if Vestas, as the market leader, artificially constrains supply to maintain margins, that could slow down the entire energy transition. They have 189 gigawatts installed globally - that's almost 20% of current global wind capacity.

**Alex:** Though to be fair, they do say they want to outgrow the total onshore market in firm order intake. So they're not planning to shrink. They think they can be selective AND grow faster than competitors.

**Jordan:** But 'outgrowing the market' while being selective about customers is a pretty narrow needle to thread. What happens when they have to choose between a profitable project and a necessary one? Do they walk away from projects in developing countries that can't pay premium prices?

**Alex:** And that tension is only going to get worse as AI and data centers create even more electricity demand. The urgency is increasing, but they're betting on being more selective. It's almost counterintuitive.

**Jordan:** Plus, their service business is supposed to grow 8-10% annually through 2030, which means they'll be servicing even more turbines with quality issues they're already struggling to fix. That customer satisfaction score of 44 could get worse before it gets better.

**Alex:** And here's another wrinkle - they're planning to make all new service vehicles zero-emission from 2025. That's actually pretty ambitious when you consider they have service operations in 71 countries with very different infrastructure.

**Jordan:** Wait, they're committing to zero-emission service vehicles while they can't hit their current emissions targets? That seems like more promises they might not be able to keep. Although I'll give them credit - 25% of their fleet is already renewably fueled.

**Alex:** So what's your take? Is this 'value over volume' strategy sustainable, or is it just short-term profit maximization before reality hits?

**Jordan:** I think there's a fundamental contradiction here. They want premium margins in a market that desperately needs to scale fast and cheaply. You can't have your cake and eat it too - either you're part of the mass deployment solution, or you're a luxury provider. The climate emergency doesn't have time for luxury.

**Alex:** But they have proven that being selective can drive massive profitability improvements - tripling margins is no joke. And that 68.4 billion euro backlog shows customers are willing to pay for quality, even with the service issues.

**Jordan:** The profitability improvement is impressive, I'll give them that. But they're betting they can stay picky while the world desperately needs 7 times more wind capacity by 2050. And with competitors who might be willing to sacrifice margins for market share, especially in developing markets.

**Alex:** And the real test isn't their 2024 success - it's whether they can maintain premium margins while scaling to meet massive demand, all while fixing their quality issues and hitting their sustainability targets. That's a lot of balls to keep in the air.

**Jordan:** Exactly. For investors and the climate, the big question is: will Vestas' pursuit of perfect customers prevent them from serving the imperfect world that desperately needs clean energy? Because if wind energy is going to more than double its share of electricity generation by 2035, we need companies focused on deployment, not just profitability.

**Alex:** That's the gamble they're making. They think the market will reward quality and that they can grow selectively while competitors fight over the scraps. But if they're wrong, they could miss the biggest growth opportunity in energy history while the planet literally heats up.

**Jordan:** And with that service backlog averaging 11-year contracts, they're locked into their current operational model for the next decade. If they can't fix their quality issues now, they'll be dealing with unsatisfied customers until the mid-2030s.

**Alex:** Which brings us full circle - can a company with a 44 customer satisfaction score really execute a 'value over volume' strategy? Or are they just hoping that being the market leader gives them enough leverage to charge premium prices despite operational problems?

**Jordan:** That's the key question. Value pricing only works if you deliver actual value. And right now, it sounds like they're pricing like a premium provider while delivering like a volume player with quality issues.

**Alex:** Exactly. For investors and the climate, the big question is: will Vestas' pursuit of perfect customers prevent them from serving the imperfect world that desperately needs clean energy? That's the gamble they're making, and we'll see if it pays off - but the stakes couldn't be higher.

---

**Friction Moment:** Jordan strongly challenges Alex on Vestas' operational problems, quality issues across all business areas, and missed sustainability targets, questioning the company's credibility and whether their selective customer strategy is hypocritical for a supposed green transition leader.

**Key Takeaway:** Vestas is executing a high-stakes strategy of selective customer focus that tripled their margins, but they're betting they can maintain this approach while scaling for massive market growth. The key tension is whether their pursuit of premium profitability will conflict with the urgent need to deploy wind energy at unprecedented scale for climate goals.
